# decision_tree_python

This project focuses on building and visualizing a Decision Tree Classifier using the popular machine learning library Scikit-learn. Decision trees are powerful and interpretable models used for classification and regression tasks. The main goal of this project is to classify outcomes from a given dataset by learning patterns and rules through a decision tree model, and visually interpret how decisions are made within the tree structure.

üß† Objective
The primary objective is to implement a Decision Tree model that can:

Accurately classify data into distinct categories.

Learn from historical data through pattern recognition.

Visualize how features influence the outcome.

Provide insights into decision paths for each classification made by the model.

üìä Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of structured, tabular data suitable for classification. Common datasets include Iris datasets. The dataset contains features (input variables) and a target label (class to be predicted).

Before training, the data undergoes preprocessing steps such as:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Splitting data into training and testing sets

Feature scaling (if needed)

üõ† Tools & Libraries Used
Python: The core programming language used to develop and execute the machine learning model.

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code: Used as the development environment for running code interactively and visualizing outputs.

Scikit-learn: Python‚Äôs leading machine learning library used for:

Model building (DecisionTreeClassifier)

Data preprocessing (train_test_split, LabelEncoder)

Evaluation (accuracy_score, confusion_matrix)

Visualization (plot_tree)

Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.

Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing the decision tree and performance metrics.

Seaborn (optional): For advanced visualization of confusion matrix or feature correlation.

üèóÔ∏è Model Building Process
Importing and preprocessing data
Data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, cleaned, and transformed into a suitable format for model training.

Splitting the dataset
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets (typically 70%-30%) to evaluate generalization capability.

Training the model
The DecisionTreeClassifier is trained on the training data, learning rules that split data into target classes based on feature thresholds.

Evaluating performance
The model is tested on the unseen test data and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

Tree Visualization
Using plot_tree(), the trained decision tree is visualized to show the decision-making process at each node, including feature splits, thresholds, and predicted classes.

‚úÖ Output & Results
The final output is a trained decision tree model with a visual representation showing:

How features affect decisions

Which features are most important

The depth and structure of the decision tree

Model accuracy and a confusion matrix are also displayed to assess how well the model performed on test data.

üì¶ Deliverables
A complete Jupyter Notebook containing:

Data loading & preprocessing

Model training & testing

Visualization and performance metrics

Visual plot of the decision tree structure

Comments explaining each step for easy understanding
